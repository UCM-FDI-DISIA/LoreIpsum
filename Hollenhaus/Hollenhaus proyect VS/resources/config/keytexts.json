      "text": "There are allegedly around 5.7 millions Danes, right? That's out of 7.125 billion humans. That means Danes make up 0.0912% of the planet. Thats not 9%---that's point zero nine percent, less than a percent. To put it another way, 99.9% of the planet are not Danes. How do we know this? Government censuses. Now, the best government censuses have a margin of error of at least 1%. So Danes make up 0.0912% of the planet, plus or minus one percent In conclusion: there is a 50/50 chance Denmark doesn't exist."
